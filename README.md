# Notes-K8s

This repository builds a Kubernetes Cluster within a AWS VPC using CloudFormation template as well as bash scripts. The Kubernetes Cluster is built from N units of EC2 Ubuntu servers (where N can be between 1 to 9 worker nodes).
There is only one K8s Master Node built on this repository.

Why not use AWS EKS instead? To have the exposure of provisioning and/or managing the K8s Master Instances, as not everyone who wants to implement containerization service can do it on EKS. Some of us still need to build our own Kubernetes Cluster.
The goal of this repository is to be able to quikly have environment where some demos can be performed; especially ones which involves K8s, NGINX and F5 Big-IP.
Further down the line, the Environment built by this repository will involve F5 CIS and F5 Big-IP, which may not be possible with AWS EKS, since F5 CIS needs tweaks of the internal interworking of the K8s Cluster itself.

Diagram below depicts the logical diagram of nodes within AWS VPC.

| CFT Label | Parameter Name | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stack Name | Stack Name | Mandatory and Unique Across Account | Give a unique name to the CloudFormation stack. Stack name will be used to prefix all resources created by this CloudFormation template. Stack name can include letters (A-Z and a-z), numbers (0-9), and dashes (-). |
| PreFix for Name Tags | TagPreFix | Optional | Give a Prefix to be used for Prefix-Naming all resources created by this CloudFormation template. In an account where there are multiple users, using initial will help to identify who owns the resources which this CloudFormation template creates. |
| Big-IP Image ID | BigIPImageID | Mandatory with Default Value | Default value uses "AllTwoBootLocations" versions of Big-IP AMI ID excerpt from [F5 Networks' AWS CloudFormation GitHub Repository](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/supported/standalone/n-nic/existing-stack/byol/f5-existing-stack-byol-n-nic-bigip.template) reference. Unless a custom Big-IP AMI ID is required, generally use "Default" value should be OK. |
| Big-IP Instance Type | BigIPInstanceType | Mandatory with Default Value | Select an EC2 Instance Type for the Big-IP instance. Note that instance type also influence the number of network interfaces and IP addresses which can be assigned into the instance. Refer to section [IP Addresses per Network Interface per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) for more details. Selecting too small instance type may hinder the CloudFormation to work as expected. |
| LAMP Server Image ID | LAMPServerImageID | Mandatory | Input AMI ID for LAMPv7 Server which has been adapted to AWS environment. "Default" value is applicable only on AWS Region Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore. Note that the LAMPv7 from [F5 Networks' Download Site](https://downloads.f5.com/) requires a "32-bit (x86)" architecture/machine, which AWS is phasing this architecture out. For example, at the time of this document writing, AWS Region Hong Kong has no longer support any "32-bit (x86)" architecture/machine. And therefore this CloudFormation template can not be executed in AWS Region Hong Kong. Refer to [LAMPv7](LAMPv7\/) for sample procedure to adapt the LAMPv7 Server to AWS Environment. |
| LAMP Server Instance Type | LAMPServerInstanceType | Mandatory with Default Value | Select an EC2 Instance Type for the LAMP Server instance. Note that instance type also influence the number of network interfaces and IP addresses which can be assigned into the instance. Refer to section [IP Addresses per Network Interface per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) for more details. Selecting too small instance type may hinder the CloudFormation to work as expected. |
| Windows Server Image ID | WindowsServerImageID | Mandatory | Input AMI ID for Windows Server 2008 R2 which has been adapted to AWS environment. "Default" value is applicable only on AWS Region Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore. Refer to [WindowsServer2008R2](WindowsServer2008R2\/) for sample procedure to adapt the Windows Server 2008 R2 to AWS Environment. |
| Windows Server Instance Type | WindowsServerInstanceType | Mandatory with Default Value | Select an EC2 Instance Type for the Windows Server 2008 R2 instance. Note that instance type also influence the number of network interfaces and IP addresses which can be assigned into the instance. Refer to section [IP Addresses per Network Interface per Instance Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) for more details. Selecting too small instance type may hinder the CloudFormation to work as expected. |
| EC2 SSH Key-Pair | EC2SSHKeyPair | Optional | This Key-Pair will be used only for Big-IP instance. Select a Key-Pair from the drop-down list of Existing Key-Pairs. If the Key-Pair you want to use is created after you execute/launch this CloudFormation template (example: on separate browser's tab you created a new Key-Pair after you execute/launch this CloudFormation template), the new Key-Pair will not be shown. You need to assign/use a Key-Pair if you'd like to access Big-IP's CLI. |
| NTP Server used by Big-IP | NTPServer | Mandatory with Default Value | Input a NTP Server's DNS Name or IP Address. The NTP Server will be used by Big-IP instance only. |
| Time Zone setting used by Big-IP | TimeZone | Mandatory with Default Value | The TimeZone information will be used only by Big-IP instance. Select/Input the Olson time zone string. Refer to the ["TZ Database Name" column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for valid optional values. |
| Big-IP Registration Key License | BigIPRegistrationKeyLicense | Mandatory | This CloudFormation template uses BYOL version (Bring Your Own License) of Big-IP AMI IDs; therefore it is Mandatory to supply the CloudFormation template with a valid Big-IP Registration Key License. Target usage of this CloudFormation template is with Evaluation Registration Key Licenses; although other types of Registration Key Licenses are also fine. If you want to use one or more "Add-On Module" licenses, you can do it with the following format/syntax:<br>`AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEEEE --add-on FFFFFFF-GGGGGGG --add-on HHHHHHH-IIIIIII` .<br>Otherwise, if you don't have any "Add-On Module" license, just input the Base Registration Key License:<br>`AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-DDDDD-EEEEEEE` . |
| Big-IP Modules to be Provisioned | BigIPModules | Mandatory | This Parameter is used by the CloudFormation template to provision the Big-IP Software Modules which you need to Activate. You list down the Big-IP Software Modules in a comma separated syntax as example:<br>`ltm:nominal,avr:nominal,gtm:nominal` .<br>Ensure you sync the provisioned modules with the configurations which you sent to the Big-IP to execute (i.e. the AS3 or TMSH Commands file). Provisionable modules are:<br>`afm`, `am`, `apm`, `asm`, `avr`, `cgnat`, `dos`, `fps`, `gtm`, `ilx`, `lc`, `ltm`, `pem`, `sslo`, `swg`, `urldb` . |
| Big-IP's Admin Password | BigIPAdminPassword | Mandatory | Enter the Password for `admin` user, which you will need to login to Big-IP's Web-Based Configuration Utility/Interface. There are a number of special characters that should be avoided; see [Characters that should not be used in passwords on F5 products](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K2873) for more details. |
| URL of the Private Key (of the SSL/TLS Certificate) | BigIPTrafficTLSKey | Mandatory with Default Value | Input a URL to a Private Key file part of SSL/TLS Certificate in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. The sample value points to a Self Signed Key which may not be a good option to use. Refer to [Certificates](Certificates\/README.md) for more detail in creating your own Self Sign Key and Certificate. |
| URL of the SSL/TLS Certificate | BigIPTrafficTLSCertificate | Mandatory with Default Value | Input a URL to a SSL/TLS Certificate file part of SSL/TLS Certificate in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format. The sample value points to a Self Signed Certificate which may not be a good option to use. Refer to [Certificates](Certificates\/README.md) for more detail in creating your own Self Sign Key and Certificate. |
| Big-IP Configuration Method/File | ConfigurationMethod | Mandatory with Default Value | This Parameter specify how you are going to configure the Big-IP instance. At the moment the options are : `None`, `AS3`, `TMSH`, `AS3 and TMSH` .<br><br>`None` means there will be no further configurations for the Big-IP instance, aside of fundamental Licensing and Network Configurations (Interfaces, VLANs, Self-IP Addresses and Default Gateway).<br><br>`AS3` means the Big-IP instance will be configured further with AS3 Commands/File.<br><br>`TMSH` means the Big-IP instance will be configured further with TMSH Commands/File.<br><br>`AS3 and TMSH` means the Big-IP instance will be configured further with AS3 and then followed by TMSH Commands/Files. You need to arrange/sync-up between the commands in the AS3 and TMSH, so there no conflicts between the commands in the two places. Architecturally it is a bad idea to have multiple sources of configurations.<br><br>When used together with UpgradeBigIP, the configuration commands are executed AFTER the upgrade process. |
| AS3 Declaration URL | AS3URL | Optional with Default Value | Input a URL to an AS3 Commands file. If you choose `AS3` or `AS3 and TMSH` on ConfigurationMethod, it is mandatory to supply a valid URL pointing to a valid AS3 Commands file. Refer to [AS3](AS3\/README.md) for more samples and information of AS3 Commands file. |
| URL of the Big-IP TMSH Commands File | BigIPTMSHConfiguration | Optional with Default Value | Input a URL to a TMSH Commands file. If you choose `TMSH` or `AS3 and TMSH` on ConfigurationMethod, it is mandatory to supply a valid URL pointing to a valid TMSH Commands file. Refer to [TMSH](TMSH\/README.md) for more samples and information of TMSH Commands file. |
| URL of the SSMTP Configuration File | SSMTPConfiguration | Mandatory with Default Value | Input a URL to a `ssmtp.conf` file. The `ssmtp.conf` file shall contain all SSMTP configuration except credential information i.e. `AuthUser` and `AuthPass` fields to be excluded out from `ssmtp.conf` file. The `AuthUser` and `AuthPass` fields will be delivered separately in this CloudFormation as SMTPUserID and SMTPUserPassword parameters). Reference: [Configuring SSMTP to Send Locally Generated eMail Messages Through the ssmtp.conf File](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K13180). The sample `ssmtp.conf` file were configured for Google's SMTP Server. |
| User ID to access the SMTP Server | SMTPUserID | Mandatory | Input the User ID needed to access the SMTP Server, to send Notification eMails to the recipient. |
| Password of the User ID | SMTPUserPassword | Mandatory | Input the Password needed to access the SMTP Server, to send Notification eMails to the recipient. Note that some SMTP Servers will not allow unrecognized client (in this case including Big-IP) to be able to login to the SMTP Server. Allowing UnSecure Applications most of the times are not working. You need to create/establish Application Password and supply the Application Password in this field as the input. |
| Big-IP Notification Recipient's eMail Address | eMailNotificationRecipient | Mandatory | Input the recipient's eMail Address for the Big-IP Notification messages. |
| URL of the additional user_alert configuration | UserAlertConfiguration | Mandatory with Default Value | URL pointing to additional configuration lines to be appended into the `user_alert.conf` file. |
| Upgrade Big-IP ? | UpgradeBigIP | Mandatory with Default Value | Whether you want to upgrade the Big-IP instance to other Big-IP software version immediately after the Big-IP instance is spun up. Use case for this is when there are vulnerability issue with Big-IP AMI ID, it takes time to update the CloudFormation template. Meanwhile any Big-IP instance created with the CloudFormation template may be exposed to the vulnerability issue. With the upgrade feature, you can upgrade the Big-IP instance immediately after it is spun up to a safe software version. Another use case is when F5 Networks launch a brand new software version with new features, and you'd like to try the new feature immediately, but the Big-IP AMI ID has not been available in AWS. |
| Upgrade Image's URL Path, of the .iso file used to upgrade the Big-IP image | UpgradeImageURLPath | Optional with Default Value | URL Path of the upgrade `.iso` image and also the `.iso.md5` files. For example if the URL of the files are:<br>https://domain.tld/path/filename.iso<br>https://domain.tld/path/filename.iso.md5<br>Input only the path for this parameter:<br>https://domain.tld/path/<br>Remember to keep the last `/` character. |
| Upgrade Image's File Name, of the .iso file used to upgrade the Big-IP image | UpgradeImageFileName | Optional with Default Value | File Name of the upgrade `.iso` image. Note that on the same folder the `.iso.md5` checksum file of the `.iso` file MUST exist. The CloudFormation template will download BOTH `.iso` and `.iso.md5` files. Missing `.iso.md5` will render the upgrade process fail. So for example if the URL of the files are:<br>https://domain.tld/path/filename.iso<br>https://domain.tld/path/filename.iso.md5<br>Input only the filename of the `.iso` file for this parameter:<br>[filename.iso](filename.iso)<br>The CloudFormation template will automatically add the `.md5` ending for downloading the `.iso.md5` file. |
| Send Anonymous Device Statistics to F5 | AllowPhoneHome | Mandatory with Default Value | The deployed Big-IP instance can send anonymous device statistics to F5 Networks to help determine how to improve solutions. If you select "No" statistics are not sent. Refer to [Overview of the Automatic Update Check and Automatic Phone Home features](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K15000) for more information. |
