# Notes-K8s

This repository builds a Kubernetes Cluster within a AWS VPC using CloudFormation template as well as bash scripting language. The Kubernetes Cluster is built from N units of EC2 Ubuntu servers (where N can be between 1 to 9 worker nodes).
There is only one K8s Master Node built on this repository.

Why not use AWS EKS instead? To have the exposure provisioning and/or managing the K8s master instances.

Public IP Address is needed for each node to install softwares and/or get containers.

Inconsistent design, either all or none of nodes have Public IP Address.
