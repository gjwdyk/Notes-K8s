# Notes-K8s

This repository builds a Kubernetes Cluster within a AWS VPC using CloudFormation template as well as bash scripts. The Kubernetes Cluster is built from N units of EC2 Ubuntu servers (where N can be between 1 to 9 worker nodes).
There is only one K8s Master Node built on this repository.

Why not use AWS EKS instead? To have the exposure of provisioning and/or managing the K8s Master Instances. The goal of this repository is to be able to quikly have environment where some demos can be performed; especially ones which involves K8s, NGINX and F5 Big-IP.

Diagram below depicts the logical diagram of nodes within AWS VPC.

Public IP Address is needed for each node to install softwares and/or get containers.

- [ ] ![K8s Cluster Logical Diagram - with Public IP for Master Node and Big-IP 1-NIC](Figures/K8sClusterLogicalDiagramMasterBigIPOneNIC.png)
Inconsistent design, either all or none of nodes have Public IP Address.

Nodes Outgoing Traffic to be NAT-ed through Big-IP.
