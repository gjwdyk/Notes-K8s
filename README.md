- [x] ![K8s Cluster Logical Diagram - with Public IP for each Node](Figures/K8sClusterLogicalDiagramAllIP.png)

- [ ] ![K8s Cluster Logical Diagram - with Public IP only for Master Node](Figures/K8sClusterLogicalDiagramMasterIP.png)
Public IP Address is needed for each node to install softwares and/or get containers.

- [ ] ![K8s Cluster Logical Diagram - with Public IP for Master Node and Big-IP 1-NIC](Figures/K8sClusterLogicalDiagramMasterBigIPOneNIC.png)
Inconsistent design, either all or none of nodes have Public IP Address.

- [x] ![K8s Cluster Logical Diagram - with Public IP for Big-IP 1-NIC](Figures/K8sClusterLogicalDiagramBigIPOneNIC.png)
Nodes Outgoing Traffic to be NAT-ed through Big-IP.
